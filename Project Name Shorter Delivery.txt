Project Idea Description:

Shorter Delivery is a delivery support system that demonstrates a real AI agent controlling the decision-making logic for a delivery driver. The system is split into a .NET MAUI frontend and a Node.js backend, with the AI agent implemented in the backend as a core decision module.

The main goal of the project is not just to build a UI, but to implement an autonomous Delivery Planning Agent that maintains an internal state, receives percepts from the environment (delivery data and driver actions), and selects actions based on rule-based and heuristic reasoning.

The environment of the agent includes:
- A set of delivery stops (addresses, priorities, and estimated travel times)
- The current position and progress of the driver
- The status of each delivery (pending, delivered, skipped)

The Delivery Planning Agent runs on the Node.js backend. It:
- Stores and updates the delivery state
- Plans an initial delivery order based on priority and estimated distance
- Recalculates the remaining route when deliveries are skipped or delayed
- Answers "co-pilot" style questions from the driver, such as:
  - How many deliveries are left
  - What is the estimated time to finish all deliveries
  - Which delivery should be prioritized next

A .NET MAUI application is used as the frontend. The MAUI app is responsible for:
- Displaying the list of deliveries and their statuses
- Showing the current suggested next stop
- Providing a simple “Driver Co-pilot” screen where the driver can press predefined question buttons (or enter simple questions)
- Sending driver actions (e.g., mark stop as delivered, skip stop, ask a question) to the backend

The AI agent itself does not rely on external AI services or large language models. All reasoning is implemented as a combination of:
- Rule-based logic (e.g., always prioritize VIP deliveries)
- Simple heuristic route planning (e.g., nearest neighbor based on estimated distance or time)
- Internal state updates inside the Node.js agent module

This architecture allows us to clearly show the core AI agent concepts:
- Percepts: updated delivery list, driver actions, and current position
- Internal state: current route, remaining stops, delivery statuses, and time estimates
- Actions: choose the next stop, replan the route, and generate explanatory answers for the driver
- Agent loop: perceive -> update state -> decide -> act -> plain

The project focuses on a clean agent design and decision support for the driver, rather than full real-time navigation. Future extensions may include integration with real map APIs, traffic data, or a separate manager-facing agent for higher-level planning.

Technologies Used:

- Frontend:
  - .NET MAUI (C#) for cross-platform UI (Android/Windows)
  - XAML and C# for page layout and interaction
  - HTTP client in MAUI to communicate with the backend

- Backend:
  - Node.js for server-side logic
  - Express.js for RESTful API endpoints between MAUI and the agent
  - A custom Delivery Planning Agent module written in JavaScript/TypeScript
  - In-memory data structures (or simple JSON storage) to represent delivery state

- AI Agent Logic:
  - Rule-based decision logic for prioritising deliveries
  - Heuristic-based route planning (e.g., nearest neighbor with priority)
  - Explanatory message generation based on the agent’s internal state and decisions

- Tools and Collaboration:
  - Git and GitHub for version control and team collaboration
  - Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code for development
