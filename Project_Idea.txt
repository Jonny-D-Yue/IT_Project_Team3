1. Project Overview
EaterAI is a goal-oriented AI agent designed to help diners decide what to eat at restaurants.

It allows users to chat with an intelligent AI assistant that understands dietary preferences, allergies, health goals, budget constraints, and cravings.

EaterAI acts as a personal food copilot that helps users make smarter and more personalized dining decisions.

This system focuses entirely on enhancing the customer experience.
2. Problem Statement
Many diners struggle with large menus, dietary restrictions, calorie tracking, and making healthy decisions.

Most current solutions only provide static menu browsing without intelligent guidance.

EaterAI solves this problem by combining AI reasoning, user data, and restaurant menus into one smart assistant.
3. Project Goals
• Build a full-stack AI agent system.
• Provide personalized, context-aware food recommendations.
• Implement conversational memory.
• Use MongoDB for flexible data storage.
• Demonstrate microservice architecture using .NET MAUI, ASP.NET Core, and Python.
